- **Ares**: Reserved for future use, with potential for various purposes as needed.
- **Asclepius**: A home server set up at your sisterâ€™s home, intended for running Home Assistant, managing storage, and other home automation tasks.
- **Demeter**: A storage server configured to manage and share large storage resources efficiently.
- **Hades**: A dedicated GitHub build server, optimized for handling continuous integration and deployment tasks.
- **Hypnos**: Configured as a kiosk system, primarily used for displaying advertising sites or other static web content.
- **Raspberry Pi k3s Cluster**: A lightweight Kubernetes cluster built with Raspberry Pis, configured for distributed computing and containerized workloads.

### 9. **Raspberry Pi k3s Cluster**
   - **Purpose**: A lightweight Kubernetes cluster built with Raspberry Pis, ideal for learning, experimentation, and running containerized workloads.
   - **Features**:
     - **Master Node**: `rpi-master` acts as the control plane for the cluster.
     - **Worker Nodes**: `rpi-worker01`, `rpi-worker02`, and `rpi-worker03` serve as the compute resources.
     - **Kubernetes**: Running k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, optimized for ARM-based devices.

## Structure

- **flake.nix**: The core file that defines configurations for Zeus, Hestia, Athena, Ares, Asclepius, Demeter, Hades, Hypnos, and the k3s Raspberry Pi cluster. It includes references to system-specific settings and packages.
- **hosts/**: Directory containing system-specific configurations for all machines and nodes.
- **modules/**: Directory containing reusable Nix modules, including:
  - **bluetooth.nix**: Configuration for managing Bluetooth devices.
  - **common.nix**: Shared settings and configurations used across multiple systems.
  - **network.nix**: Networking setup and management.
  - **nix.nix**: Configuration related to the Nix package manager itself.
  - **sound.nix**: Audio setup and management.
  - **terminal.nix**: Terminal emulator configurations and tweaks.
  - **virtualisation.nix**: Settings for virtualization tools and environments.
  - **wasm.nix**: Configuration for WebAssembly (WASM) development.

## TODO

- **Overlays Directory**: Implement an `overlays` directory to manage custom Nix overlays for package modifications or extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Nix and Flakes support are enabled on your system. Follow the [Nix installation guide](https://nixos.org/download.html) to set up Nix or NixOS.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gavdaly/nix-config.git
   cd nix-config
   ```

2. **Apply the Configuration**:
   - Use the configuration for your machine:
     ```bash
     sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
     ```

3. **Rebuild the System**:
   - Rebuild your system with the applied configurations:
     ```bash
     sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
     ```

4. **Customization**:
   - Modify the relevant `flake.nix` to customize each system's setup.
   - Rebuild the system using the commands above to apply your changes.

5. **Format the Configuration**:
   - Use `nixpkgs-fmt` to automatically format your Nix files:
     ```bash
     nixpkgs-fmt .
     ```
